# 🛒 Amazon Automation Testing Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **End-to-End Automation Testing framework** built using **Java, Selenium WebDriver, and TestNG**.

The automation simulates a real user workflow on an e-commerce website including:

🔍 Searching for a product  
📦 Selecting the product  
🛒 Adding the product to the cart  
💳 Navigating to the payment page  
✅ Reaching the order confirmation page  

The framework follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern to keep automation code **clean, reusable, and maintainable**.
